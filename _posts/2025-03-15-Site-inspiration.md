<!-- I recently wanted to experiment with [home-row mods](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods). I have a QMK enabled keyboard, but I want my mods to be portable for when I'm travelling and don't have my external keyboard. There are several remapping tools that can implement home-row mods on linux, notably [KMonad](https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad), [Kanata](https://github.com/jtroo/kanata), and [keyd](https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd). While these tools have different feature sets and goals, they all overlap in meeting my needs. The deciding factor for me is latency, I want the tool that imparts smallest additional latency to my typing[^a].

*Note about latency testing: robust end-to-end latency testing is done using a circuit that triggers a key-press and a light sensor to catch actual rendering*[^b].

I've been meaning to build a site the dawn of eternity. 

Surprisingly, I never did. I guess one of the perks of working in full-stack dev is that once you're done with the 9-5, you do not feel like building another site for the sake of "fun". But fast-forward a bit into the future, and I'm returning to college. At this point, making a web-page seems to be a no-brainer.

So it was not long until I ran into [this site](https://www.inmoth.ca). This showed me how cool a site can look without really adding any flashy stuff, and hence became the main inspiration for mine. I'm using jekyll along with github-pages, and I have future plans to add some more content ([looking at you](https://rajagopalvenkat.com/teaching/CS5100/)), maybe showcase some of the cool things I've been working on, and add a proper portfolio page as well, but for now, I'm happy with how this page turned out.
